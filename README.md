Firefox-OS-Runtime
==================

A Firefox plugin which has several API mocks for rapid development on FFOS.

Usage
-------------

- Run a gaia profile in Firefox (See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Using_Gaia_in_Firefox)
- Launch the plugin from: https://builder.addons.mozilla.org/package/175585/latest/
- Click the 'eye' icon at the top left.
- Navigate to: system.gaiamobile.org:8080 to see the system application.


Developers
-------------

I generally work inside of nightly, and I've found using the builder addon is easiest: https://builder.addons.mozilla.org/package/175585/latest/

We're going to keep the builder addon fully up-to-date with the github code for now. This could change if people want to start contributing.
